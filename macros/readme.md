## Hurt or Heal [dnd5e]
Macro I made for my game to make it easier to quickly adjust your character's health. Pop up a dialog with options to heal, hurt or add temp hp to your assigned character. Uses dnd5e native functions and paths, so unfortunately not system agnostic. warning: it also has a poor man's arcane ward implementation/clause, might want to rip that out. >_>  
<sub>Modules: None.</sub>  
<sub>Code examples of: iterating or looping through object properties, dialog.</sub>
